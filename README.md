# hello-world
First repository (hope this is the kick off)!
My name is Eric, I'm an aspiring computer programmer.  I'm not sure what type of programming path I am interested in, but I have a passion for this field.
I enjoy playing video games such as Overwatch, Hearthstone, Pokemon, and Legend of Zelda.
